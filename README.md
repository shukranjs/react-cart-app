## About

This application demonstrates the use of React's `useReducer` hook and `Context API` for managing global state, specifically for handling the shopping cart functionality. `useReducer` is utilized to manage complex state transitions in a more predictable and testable manner, while `Context API` facilitates the passing of state and actions to nested components without prop drilling.
